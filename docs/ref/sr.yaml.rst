sr.yaml
=======

``sr.yaml`` is a file in every SRVC project that defines project configuration and the review flows. Here is a sample ``sr.yaml`` `from the srvc-template repository <https://github.com/insilica/srvc-template/blob/main/sr.yaml>`_:

.. code-block:: yaml

    reviewer: mailto:user@example.com

    labels:
      category:
        question: Category
        type: categorical
        categories:
          - A
          - B
          - C

      include:
        json-schema: boolean
        question: Include?
        required: true

    flows:
      label:
        steps:
          - run-embedded: remove-reviewed

          - run-embedded: label-web
            labels: [include, category]
            port: 5005

    sources:
      - step:
          uses: github:insilica/srvc-pubmed-search
          query: angry bees

reviewer
========

Whenever :doc:`labels </ref/event/label>` are :doc:`answered </ref/event/label-answer>`, the reviewer is recorded as the one providing the answer.
This is often ``mailto:`` followed by an email address, but it can also be a web address.
For instance, the reviewer could be the URL of a GitHub project that uses a machine learning model to provide answers.

labels
======

This section defines two labels.
The first is a categorical label, which allows a reviewer to select one of several pre-defined answers.
The categories here are just examples with no real meaning.
The second is a boolean label, which can have an answer of either true or false.
In this case, it allows a reviewer to answer whether or not a document is relevant to the project.

flows
=====

This section defines a review flow named "label".
The flow allows a reviewer to provide answers for each label and document combination.
It uses the :doc:`generator step </ref/step/generator/>` to retrieve existing documents and answers, the :doc:`remove-reviewed step </ref/step/remove-reviewed>` to skip documents that have already been reviewed, and the :doc:`label-web step </ref/step/label-web/>` to allow the reviewer to assign answers to documents.

sources
=======

This section defines a list of event sources.
One source is provided.
It uses the :doc:`PubMed search step </ref/step/pubmed-search/>` to import documents into the project.
