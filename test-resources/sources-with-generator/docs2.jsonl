{"data":{"abstract":"The estrogenicity of decyl glucoside was asserted as a non-endocrine disruptive surfactant with its preparation method using zeolite catalysts. Its estrogenicity was estimated using E-assay method. The decyl glucoside was synthesized by direct glucosidation from D-glucose with 1-decanol. The conversion and yield were improved with increasing of amount of acid sites of the zeolite catalysts. The decyl glucopyranoside is more hydrophilic than nonylphenol and has a high wettability. The decyl glucopyranosides exhibited extremely lower proliferation of estrogenic cell compared with nonylphenol.","title":"Decyl Glucoside Synthesized by Direct Glucosidation of D-Glucose Over Zeolite Catalysts and Its Estrogenicity as Non-Endocrine Disruptive Surfactant"},"uri":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30360227/","type":"document"}
{"data":{"abstract":"The Cosmetic Ingredient Review (CIR) Expert Panel assessed the safety of 19 alkyl glucosides as used in cosmetics and concluded that these ingredients are safe in the present practices of use and concentration when formulated to be nonirritating. Most of these ingredients function as surfactants in cosmetics, but some have additional functions as skin-conditioning agents, hair-conditioning agents, or emulsion stabilizers. The Panel reviewed the available animal and clinical data on these ingredients. Since glucoside hydrolases in human skin are likely to break down these ingredients to release their respective fatty acids and glucose, the Panel also reviewed CIR reports on the safety of fatty alcohols and were able to extrapolate data from those previous reports to support safety.","title":"Safety assessment of decyl glucoside and other alkyl glucosides as used in cosmetics\n"},"uri":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24174472/","type":"document"}
