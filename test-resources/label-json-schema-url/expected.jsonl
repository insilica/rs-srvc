{"data":{"abstract":"Sodium laureth sulfate is a member of a group of salts of sulfated ethoxylated alcohols, the safety of which was evaluated by the Cosmetic Ingredient Review (CIR) Expert Panel for use in cosmetics. Sodium and ammonium laureth sulfate have not evoked adverse responses in any toxicological testing. Sodium laureth sulfate was demonstrated to be a dermal and ocular irritant but not a sensitizer. The Expert Panel recognized that there are data gaps regarding use and concentration of these ingredients. However, the overall information available on the types of products in which these ingredients are used and at what concentrations indicates a pattern of use. The potential to produce irritation exists with these salts of sulfated ethoxylated alcohols, but in practice they are not regularly seen to be irritating because of the formulations in which they are used. These ingredients should be used only when they can be formulated to be nonirritating.","title":"Final report of the amended safety assessment of sodium laureth sulfate and related salts of sulfated ethoxylated alcohols"},"hash":"Qmc2diLjUoiFx4SNEqGhDNEv9JwKvd1GfGpkUwbwLpTsXm","type":"document","uri":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20634505/"}

{"data":{"abstract":"Sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS)-induced contact dermatitis is a commonly used model for testing the effects of different topical formulations. According to the guidelines, the volar forearms are the preferred testing site; however, other anatomical locations have been used in previous research, particularly the upper back as the clinically used site for testing different antigens.","title":"Anatomical location differences in sodium lauryl sulfate‐induced irritation\n"},"hash":"QmRayyiiHGE4PuFkDnLky8DZKvvAG1tBnVdSSY6Kn52ag1","type":"document","uri":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31259392/"}

{"data":{"abstract":"Background: Elevated levels of skin sebum are associated with the growth of Propionibacterium acnes. Intensive degreasing of the skin reduces Propionibacterium acnes but also may cause skin irritation.\n\nAims: We assessed the degreasing effect and skin tolerability of a botanical face cleanser with hops and willow bark extract and disodium cocoyl glutamate as mild cleansing agent compared to a standard face cleanser with sodium laureth sulfate (SLES).\n\nMaterials and methods: A total of 21 healthy volunteers with normal to oily skin were enrolled in this study. Both cleansers were applied twice a day on the left or right side of the forehead for 15 days in a standardized manner. Bioengineering measurements were performed on day 8 and 15 and on day 17 after an application break of 48 hours. The sebum level was determined using a Sebumeter® , and skin redness was measured using a Mexameter® .\n\nResults: The botanical face cleanser significantly reduced the sebum level (P < .01) in the test area on day 17. The SLES containing cleanser showed a statistically relevant degreasing effect already on day 15, but after the application break the sebum level increased again on day 17. None of the cleansers caused skin irritation as determined by skin redness measurements.\n\nConclusions: In contrast to the SLES containing cleanser, the botanical skin cleanser with hops and willow bark extract had a continuous degreasing effect without reactive seborrhoe after the treatment break. Skin cleansing without SLES might be advantageous for sensitive skin.\n\nKeywords: Mexameter; Sebumeter; acne; degreasing; face cleanser.","title":"Effect of a botanical cleansing lotion on skin sebum and erythema of the face: A randomized controlled blinded half-side comparison"},"hash":"QmNTzf7woQ1JmYN8iy2HYS6CiyrbvLcdXdi6F2hCQbhubM","type":"document","uri":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30022595/"}
